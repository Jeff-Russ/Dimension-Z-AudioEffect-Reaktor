# JRussAudioTools-Reaktor
A collection of Reaktor .ens ensembles made almost entirely in Core.

### Status: ###
* now longer actively developed but rather just put here as an archive
* tested on a Mac with Reaktor v5.9

### About: ###
* Dimension-Z is a loose emulation of Roland "motionless" line of chorus effect
* Dim-Z also has delay and feedback for early-Lexicon like effects

### Known Issues: ###
* when switching preset while audio is running; buffers can spit out garbage noise.
* has ugly GUI
